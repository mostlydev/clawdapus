## How to Resume

If context is lost, read these files in order:
1. `docs/plans/2026-02-20-phase2-runtime-driver.md` — full implementation plan
2. `docs/plans/phase2-progress.md` — this file (which tasks are done)
3. `docs/plans/2026-02-20-vertical-spike-clawfile-build.md` — Phase 1 completion + Phase 2 outline
4. `CLAUDE.md` — project conventions

Then pick up at the first NOT STARTED task in the active phase plan.

## Phase 2 Hardening Complete

All 15 tasks done (11 core + 4 hardening). Exit criteria met:
- `go test ./...` — all packages pass
- `go build -o bin/claw ./cmd/claw` — binary compiles
- `read_only: true` + `tmpfs` + bounded restart in all generated compose output
- Fail-closed: missing agent file → hard error, nil driver result → safe defaults
- Path traversal guard on contract resolution
- Deterministic compose output (sorted service names, stable ordinals)
- HealthProbe wired: real docker exec of `openclaw health --json` with ParseHealthJSON
- `claw health` CLI: table output of service health via driver probes
- Network isolation: `claw-internal` network with `internal: true` for all claw services

## Phase 3 Slice 2: Service-emitted Surface Skills

**Plan:** `docs/plans/2026-02-21-phase3-surface-manifests.md` (addendum)
**Status:** DONE

| # | Task | Status | Commit | Notes |
|---|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Define service-emitted priority model | DONE | — | Service emits via `claw.skill.emit`, operator override, fallback stub |
| 2 | Document label and extraction behavior | DONE | — | README + `SKILL` docs + plan addendum updated |
| 3 | Add Ports to ResolvedSurface + GeneratedSkill type | DONE | `d559d62` | Ports field + GeneratedSkill type in driver/types.go |
| 4 | Parse expose from pod services | DONE | `f40b568` | Expose []string, int coercion, tests |
| 5 | Extract claw.skill.emit label in inspect | DONE | `1ef70ed` | SkillEmit field, ordered before claw.skill.N |
| 6 | Service skill fallback generation | DONE | `c230882` | runtime.GenerateServiceSkillFallback + ExtractServiceSkill |
| 7 | Enrich surfaces with ports | DONE | `697115e` | compose_up populates Ports from Service.Expose |
| 8 | GenerateServiceSkill in openclaw driver | DONE | `8db451b` | Fallback markdown from ResolvedSurface |
| 9 | Wire claw.skill.emit into compose_up | DONE | `275baca` | resolveSkillEmit extracts from image, writes to runtime dir |

| 14 | Service target validation in compose_emit | DONE | `8dcdeef` | Fail-closed: unknown service surface target = error |
| 15 | Final verification | DONE | — | go test, go build, go vet all clean |

### Precedence model (implemented)

- Service-emitted skill (`claw.skill.emit`) extracted from image at compose-up time
- Operator-provided explicit `surface-<name>.md` entries override by basename (`SKILL`/`x-claw.skills`)
- Generic fallback generated only when no source skill exists
- `mergeResolvedSkills(generatedSkills, skills)` — generated is base, image/pod skills win

**Completed:** 2026-02-20

## Phase 3.5: HANDLE Directive + Social Topology Projection

**Plan:** `docs/plans/2026-02-21-phase35-handle-directive.md`
**Status:** DONE

| # | Task | Status | Commit | Notes |
|---|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add HandleDirective to Clawfile parser | DONE | — | `Handles []string` in ClawConfig, HANDLE directive parsed + dedup guard |
| 2 | Emit HANDLE labels in Dockerfile | DONE | — | `LABEL claw.handle.<platform>=true` |
| 3 | Parse claw.handle.* labels in inspect | DONE | — | `ClawInfo.Handles []string`, sorted, only "true"/"1" accepted |
| 4 | Add handles to x-claw block and pod parser | DONE | — | String shorthand + full map form with guild/channel hierarchy |
| 5 | Add Handles to ResolvedClaw | DONE | — | `HandleInfo{ID, Username, Guilds[]GuildInfo{Channels[]ChannelInfo}}` in driver/types.go |
| 6 | Wire handles into ResolvedClaw in compose_up | DONE | — | `rc.Handles = svc.Claw.Handles` |
| 7 | Generate CLAW_HANDLE_* env vars + inject into all services | DONE | — | `_ID`, `_USERNAME`, `_GUILDS`, `_JSON` broadcast to every service in pod |
| 8 | OpenClaw driver — HANDLE enables platform config | DONE | — | `channels.<platform>.enabled = true` for discord/slack/telegram |
| 9 | CLAWDAPUS.md — Handles section | DONE | — | Guild/channel tree + handle skills in skills index |
| 10 | Generate handle skill files | DONE | — | `skills/handle-<platform>.md` per claw; `resolveHandleSkills` in compose_up |
| 11 | Update openclaw example | DONE | — | `handles:` with full discord guild/channel map in claw-pod.yml |
| 12 | Final verification | DONE | — | `go test ./...`, `go build`, `go vet` all clean |

### Design decisions (Phase 3.5)

- HandleInfo carries full membership schema: guild IDs + names + channel IDs + names
- Platform keys normalized to lowercase in pod parser (bug fix from Codex review)
- Duplicate HANDLE directives in Clawfile → hard parse error (fail-closed)
- Label value semantics: only `"true"` or `"1"` treated as enabled in inspect
- CLAW_HANDLE_* env vars injected at lowest priority (below pod env, below driver env)
- handle-<platform>.md skills generated per claw in svcRuntimeDir/skills/
- Skills section in CLAWDAPUS.md: handle-* and surface-* auto-generated filtered from operator section

## Phase 3 Slice 4: Social Topology — mentionPatterns, allowBots, Peer Handles

**Status:** DONE
**Commit:** `f110daa`

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add `PeerHandles` to `ResolvedClaw` | DONE | `driver/types.go`: `map[string]map[string]*HandleInfo` |
| 2 | Pre-pass in `compose_up.go` to collect pod handles | DONE | Cheap first pass; injects `PeerHandles` before `Materialize` |
| 3 | `allowBots: true` unconditional on `channels.discord` | DONE | Enables bot-to-bot messaging; no config knob |
| 4 | `agents.list` generation with `mentionPatterns` | DONE | Text `(?i)\b@?<username>\b` + native `<@!?<id>>`; matches real openclaw schema |
| 5 | Guild `users[]` = own ID + all peer Discord IDs (sorted) | DONE | `discordBotIDs(rc)` helper; enables inter-agent mentions |
| 6 | Per-channel `{allow, requireMention}` entries | DONE | Each declared channel gets explicit allow entry |
| 7 | 4 new config tests | DONE | allowBots, mentionPatterns, guild users, peer handle aggregation |
| 8 | trading-api webhook mention proof | DONE | Webhook posts `<@TIVERTON_ID> <@WESTIN_ID>`; `User-Agent: DiscordBot` required (Cloudflare error 1010) |
| 9 | Spike test: verify mentions in Discord channel | DONE | `spikeVerifyDiscordGreeting` checks both agent IDs appear |

### Design decisions

- `PeerHandles` collected in cheap pre-pass over already-parsed pod YAML — no image inspection needed
- `allowBots` is unconditional; a bot that can't hear other bots is useless in a pod
- `mentionPatterns` order: text username first (human-readable), then Discord native `<@!?id>` (client-rendered)
- Webhook `User-Agent` must be `DiscordBot (url, version)` — bare `Python-urllib` triggers Cloudflare 1010
- `CLAW_HANDLE_*` env vars already broadcast to ALL services (including non-claw); no extra wiring needed for webhook mentions

## LLM Configuration Workers (Phase X)

**Plan:** `docs/plans/2026-02-21-llm-configuration-workers.md`
**Status:** DESIGN ONLY — implement after Phase 3 Slice 3 is proven

First target: migrate channel surface config translation (Phase 3 Slice 3, Task 4) from hardcoded driver ops to LLM worker intent-generator + verifier model.

---

## Phase 4.7: Nanobot + PicoClaw Drivers (Driver Parity)

**Plan:** `docs/plans/2026-03-01-driver-parity-matrix.md`
**Status:** DONE
**Executed by:** Codex

| # | Task | Status | Commit | Notes |
|---|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Shared model/platform helpers | DONE | `30c21da` | `SplitModelRef`, `CollectProviders`, `PlatformTokenVar` (14 platforms) |
| 2 | Nanobot driver (validate, materialize, health, config) | DONE | `30c21da` | `/root/.nanobot` mounts, JSON config, container-running health |
| 3 | Nanobot config generation (direct + cllama) | DONE | `30c21da` | HANDLE discord/telegram/slack, CONFIGURE override, INVOKE cron |
| 4 | Nanobot unit tests (12 tests) | DONE | `30c21da` | Registration, validation failures, config gen, cron store |
| 5 | PicoClaw driver (validate, materialize, health, config) | DONE | `d8ebb23` | Non-root `/home/picoclaw/.picoclaw`, HTTP `/health`+`/ready` |
| 6 | PicoClaw config generation (model_list + cllama) | DONE | `d8ebb23` | `model_list[]` schema, `openai/<ref>` protocol, 13 platforms |
| 7 | PicoClaw unit tests (15 tests) | DONE | `d8ebb23` | Registration, validation, config gen, health probe parsing |
| 8 | Build + health command registration | DONE | `30c21da` | Blank imports in `build.go` + `compose_health.go` |
| 9 | CLI scaffold (init, agent add) | DONE | `d8ebb23` | `parseClawType`, `defaultBaseImageForClawType` updated |
| 10 | Examples (nanobot + picoclaw) | DONE | `d8ebb23` | Minimal Clawfile + pod + .env.example + README |
| 11 | Integration test | DONE | `d8ebb23` | `driver_newtypes_integration_test.go` (206 lines) |
| 12 | Regression tests (scaffold + build) | DONE | `85303e0` | Type validation, base image defaults, build label acceptance |

### Design decisions (Phase 4.7)

- Nanobot mounts at `/root/.nanobot` (upstream runs as root); PicoClaw at `/home/picoclaw/.picoclaw` (upstream non-root user)
- PicoClaw uses model-centric config (`model_list[]` + `agents.defaults.model_name`), not legacy provider-only shape
- PicoClaw CLLAMA emits `openai/<provider/model>` protocol for HTTP proxy compatibility
- PicoClaw requires at least one supported HANDLE (fail-closed, matching upstream `no channels enabled` behavior)
- Both drivers validate CONFIGURE DSL with driver-specific prefix (`nanobot config set` / `picoclaw config set`)
- INVOKE limited to 5-field cron only; `at`/`every` deferred
- Shared helpers extracted to `internal/driver/shared/` to reduce duplication across drivers

**Completed:** 2026-03-02

---

## Key Decisions Made During Execution

- CONFIGURE directives now emitted as `claw.configure.N` labels (Task 1)
- CLI commands are `claw up/down/ps/logs/health` (top-level, no compose namespace)
- `read_only: true` + `tmpfs` + bounded `restart: on-failure` for all Claw services
- JSON (not JSON5) for config generation — JSON is valid JSON5, YAGNI
- Locally-built images for tests, no alpine/openclaw dependency in critical path
